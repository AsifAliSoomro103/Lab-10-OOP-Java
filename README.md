# Lab-09-OOP-Java
This lab explores key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java, specifically focusing on abstract classes and interfaces. Through practical code examples, the lab demonstrates how abstraction is used to design flexible and scalable software, and how interfaces support multiple inheritance and contract-based programming in Java.
